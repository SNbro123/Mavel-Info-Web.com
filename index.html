        <h2>Marvel Commic History</h2>

        <p class="commics">Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company 
            later known as Marvel Comics under the name Timely Publications in 1939.Goodman, who 
            had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into the emerging—and by then already highly
             popular—new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street,
              New York City, he officially held the titles of editor, managing editor, and business manager, 
            with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother) officially listed as publisher.
          <br><br>
          Goodman hired his wife's 16-year-old cousin, Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939.
           When editor Simon left the company in late 1941, Goodman made Lieber—by then writing pseudonymously as 
           "Stan Lee"—interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during his 
           military service in World War II. Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of different titles.
           <br><br>

          Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of 
          corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff. One of these shell companies through 
          which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May 1944). As well,
           some comics' covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946 – 47),
           were labeled "A Marvel Magazine" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961.<br.<br></p>

            <h3>Marvel Entertainment Group </h3>
            <br><br>
            In 1986, Marvel's parent, Marvel Entertainment Group, was sold to New World Entertainment, 
            which within three years sold it to MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Revlon executive Ronald 
            Perelman in 1989. In 1991 Perelman took MEG public. Following the rapid rise of this stock, 
            Perelman issued a series of junk bonds that he used to acquire other entertainment companies, secured by MEG stock.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="box-2">
            In late 1994, Marvel acquired the comic book distributor Heroes World Distribution to use as its own 
            exclusive distributor. As the industry's other major publishers made exclusive distribution deals with other c
            ompanies, the ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major distributor in North America, Diamond Comic
             Distributors Inc. Then, by the middle of the decade, the industry had slumped, and in December 1996 MEG filed for 
             Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In early 1997, when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also
             forged an exclusive deal with Marvel giving the company its own section of its comics catalog Previews.<br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="box-3">

             To help Marvel expand its storytelling during the early to mid-1990s, they began to experiment
              with their series, including Saturday-morning cartoons and various comic collaborations to explore new genres. 
              In 1992, they released the X-Men: The Animated Series which was aired on Fox Kids, they later released a Spider-Man:
               The Animated Series on the network as well. In 1993, Marvel teamed up with Thomas Nelson to create Christian media genre 
               comics, including a Christian superhero named The Illuminator, they made adaptions of Christian novels too, including In His 
               Steps, The Screwtape Letters, and The Pilgrim's Progress. In 1996, Marvel had some of its titles participate in "Heroe
               s Reborn", a crossover that allowed Marvel to relaunch some of its flagship characters such as the Avengers and the Fantastic
                Four, and outsource them to the studios of two of the former Marvel artists turned Image Comics founders, Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld.
                 The relaunched titles, which saw the characters transported to a parallel universe with a history distinct
              from the mainstream Marvel Universe, were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry.
